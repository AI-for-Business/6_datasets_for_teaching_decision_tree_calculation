# What is this repository?
This repository is a collection of 6 original synthetic datasets (called the Cooking, Gym, Diet, License, StressLevel,
and Conditions dataset) intended to teach how to calculate decision trees in Artificial Intelligence. These datasets

SVG) and step-by-step instructions on how to get to the correct solution.

# What can I use it for?
Use it for teaching, as an exercise, or as an exam task. Use the diagrams in your presentation slides and hand out the
CSV file to your audience.

# What do I need in order to use it?
No specific hard- or software is required. No licenses are required. You need to be able to handle JPG, PDF, and
CSV files.
